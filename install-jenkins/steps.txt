By default the service account doesnot add into RBAC in cluster for that reason
You should add the service account using a super user 

Execute
gcloud init
select create a new configuration
type user
select your user as admin of GCP
get credential from cluster using the next command:
 gcloud container clusters get-credentials esparta-cluster --zone us-west1-b --project devops-k8-86

after that add the service account into RBAC

kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding  --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=custom-sa-k8s@devo
ps-k8-86.iam.gserviceaccount.com
